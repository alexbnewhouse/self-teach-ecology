# Competency Framework

This framework defines what beginner, proficient, and advanced performance looks like across the curriculum.

## Domain 1: Ecological Theory

| Level | Descriptor |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explains core concepts (population growth, niches, trophic structure) in isolation |
| Proficient | Connects population, community, ecosystem, and landscape dynamics with examples |
| Advanced | Integrates cross-scale ecological mechanisms and critiques model assumptions |

## Domain 2: Quantitative and Computational Methods

| Level | Descriptor |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Runs provided workflows and interprets outputs at a basic level |
| Proficient | Selects and justifies methods for ecological questions; produces reproducible notebooks |
| Advanced | Builds robust pipelines, evaluates uncertainty, compares model classes, and documents limitations |

## Domain 3: Conservation Decision and Governance Analysis

| Level | Descriptor |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Describes policy frameworks and institutional actors |
| Proficient | Applies governance frameworks (collective action, IAD, policy process) to case studies |
| Advanced | Produces rigorous, evidence-based policy analysis integrating social and ecological outcomes |

## Domain 4: Field and Applied Practice

| Level | Descriptor |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Understands core field protocols and monitoring concepts |
| Proficient | Designs practical monitoring and restoration plans aligned to standards |
| Advanced | Executes adaptive monitoring logic with explicit indicators, thresholds, and iteration plans |

## Domain 5: Scholarly Synthesis and Communication

| Level | Descriptor |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Summarizes literature accurately |
| Proficient | Synthesizes multiple literatures into coherent argumentation |
| Advanced | Produces publication-caliber writing with transparent methods and defensible claims |

## Evidence Portfolio Checklist

- At least 6 reproducible computational notebooks
- At least 4 substantial written analyses (2,000+ words each)
- At least 1 restoration or monitoring design document
- Completed comprehensive exam blueprint responses
- Capstone project repository with full reproducibility artifacts
