# Module 7: Rewilding Theory & Practice

**Duration:** 8 weeks  
**Effort:** 15-20 hours/week

## 📋 Overview

Rewilding represents a paradigm shift in conservation, emphasizing restoration of natural processes and ecological complexity rather than maintaining static ecosystems. This module explores the theory, practice, and controversies surrounding rewilding as a conservation strategy.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Define and distinguish different approaches to rewilding
2. Understand the role of trophic interactions in ecosystem function
3. Evaluate evidence for trophic cascades and ecosystem effects of rewilding
4. Assess feasibility and challenges of rewilding projects
5. Understand the social, political, and ethical dimensions of rewilding
6. Design a rewilding strategy for a specific context
