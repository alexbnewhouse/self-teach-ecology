## 💻 Exercises & Activities

### Week 1-2: Understanding the Biodiversity Crisis

**Exercise 2.1: Biodiversity Hotspot Analysis**
- Identify and map the world's biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al. 2000 definition)
- For one hotspot, analyze: endemic species, threats, protection status
- Compare with wilderness areas (low threat, high biodiversity)
- **Deliverable:** Report with maps and comparative analysis

**Exercise 2.2: Extinction Risk Assessment**
- Choose 5-10 species across different taxa and threat categories
- Review IUCN Red List criteria and assessments
- Analyze factors contributing to different threat levels
- **Deliverable:** Comparative threat analysis table with discussion

### Week 3-4: Threats to Biodiversity

**Exercise 2.3: HIPPO Analysis**
- For a chosen region, quantify threats: Habitat loss, Invasive species, Pollution, Population growth, Overharvesting
- Use published data to assess relative impact of each threat
- Create threat matrix showing which species/ecosystems are most affected
- **Deliverable:** Threat assessment report with visualization

**Exercise 2.4: Climate Vulnerability Assessment**
- Select an ecosystem or species of interest
- Assess climate change vulnerabilities using published frameworks
- Map potential range shifts under climate scenarios
- Propose adaptation strategies
- **Deliverable:** Vulnerability assessment with maps and recommendations

### Week 5-6: Conservation Strategies

**Exercise 2.5: Reserve Design Project**
- Using hypothetical or real landscape data, design a reserve network
- Apply principles: size, shape, connectivity, representation
- Use SLOSS debate (Single Large Or Several Small) considerations
- Calculate coverage of conservation targets
- **Deliverable:** Reserve design with justification report

**Exercise 2.6: Conservation Triage Exercise**
- Given limited resources, prioritize 10 conservation projects
- Use frameworks: IUCN status, endemism, ecosystem services, cultural value
- Justify decisions with quantitative and qualitative reasoning
- Address ethical considerations in triage decisions
- **Deliverable:** Prioritization matrix with written justification

### Week 7-8: Synthesis & Application

**Project 2: Conservation Strategy Design**
Choose a real conservation challenge (species or ecosystem) and develop a comprehensive conservation strategy:
