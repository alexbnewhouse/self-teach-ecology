# Module 1: Ecology Fundamentals

**Duration:** 8 weeks  
**Effort:** 15-20 hours/week

## 📋 Overview

This foundational module introduces core ecological concepts essential for understanding conservation ecology and rewilding. You'll explore how organisms interact with their environment and each other across multiple scales: populations, communities, and ecosystems.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Explain fundamental ecological principles (energy flow, nutrient cycling, succession)
2. Understand population dynamics and growth models
3. Analyze species interactions (competition, predation, mutualism, parasitism)
4. Describe community structure and biodiversity patterns
5. Explain ecosystem processes and services
6. Apply ecological theory to conservation problems
