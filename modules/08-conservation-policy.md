# Module 8: Conservation Policy & Social Science

**Duration:** 6 weeks  
**Effort:** 15-20 hours/week

## 📋 Overview

Conservation is as much a social and political challenge as it is a biological one. This module bridges natural and social sciences, exploring how policy, governance, economics, and human behavior shape conservation outcomes. For students with political science backgrounds, this module connects your existing expertise to conservation contexts.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Understand major environmental policy frameworks and instruments
2. Analyze institutional arrangements for conservation governance
3. Apply concepts from environmental economics to conservation
4. Evaluate community-based conservation approaches
5. Understand human dimensions of conservation (attitudes, behavior, conflict)
6. Assess the role of power, politics, and justice in conservation
7. Design policy interventions for conservation challenges
