# Module 0: Prerequisites & Self-Assessment

**Estimated time**: 10–30 hours (depending on background gaps)

---

## Purpose

This module helps you assess what you already know and identify targeted gaps to fill before diving into the core ecology curriculum. Given your background in Political Science (PhD) and Data Science (MS), you bring substantial strengths in research design, quantitative methods, policy analysis, and programming. This module focuses on the **biology and earth science foundations** you may need to refresh or acquire.

## Gap-Filling Resources

### If you scored 1–2 on Biology Foundations

**Recommended textbook**:
> Campbell, N.A., & Reece, J.B. (2021). *Biology* (12th ed.). Pearson.
> - Focus on: Chapters on evolution (Part 4), ecology (Part 8), and plant biology (Part 6)
> - You do NOT need to read the entire book — target the ecological foundations

**Free alternatives**:
- [Khan Academy: Biology](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology) — Excellent for refreshing core concepts
- [MIT OCW 7.014: Introductory Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-014-introductory-biology-spring-2005/) — Ecology-focused intro bio course
- [OpenStax Biology 2e](https://openstax.org/details/books/biology-2e) — Free, peer-reviewed textbook

**Key topics to prioritize** (in order of importance for this curriculum):
1. Evolution by natural selection and speciation mechanisms
2. Trophic levels and energy flow in ecosystems
3. Biogeochemical cycles (especially carbon and nitrogen)
4. Basic genetics (alleles, gene flow, genetic drift) — needed for Module 6
5. Plant biology essentials (photosynthesis, primary production, succession)

### If you scored 1–2 on Earth Science Foundations

**Recommended resource**:
> Christopherson, R.W. (2018). *Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography* (10th ed.). Pearson.
> - Focus on climate, biogeography, and soils chapters

**Free alternatives**:
- [NOAA Climate Education](https://www.climate.gov/teaching) — Climate systems primer
- [Fundamentals of Physical Geography (free online textbook)](http://www.physicalgeography.net/) by M. Pidwirny
- [Soil Science Simplified](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/soils) — USDA soil science primer

### Quantitative Skills Tune-Up (if needed)

You likely have these covered, but if you need ecology-specific quantitative tools:

> Gotelli, N.J., & Ellison, A.M. (2013). *A Primer of Ecological Statistics* (2nd ed.). Sinauer Associates.
> - Excellent bridge between general statistics and ecological applications

> Stevens, M.H.H. (2009). *A Primer of Ecology with R*. Springer.
> - If you prefer R for ecological modeling

## Introductory Ecology Warm-Up

Before Module 1, read or watch the following to build ecological intuition:

### Essential Pre-Reading
1. **Wilson, E.O. (1992). *The Diversity of Life*. Harvard University Press.**
   - A masterful, accessible introduction to biodiversity and extinction by one of the field's founders
   - Read: Chapters 1–5, 12–14

2. **Leopold, A. (1949). *A Sand County Almanac*. Oxford University Press.**
   - The philosophical foundation of conservation ecology
   - Read: "The Land Ethic" (Part III) at minimum

3. **Kolbert, E. (2014). *The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History*. Henry Holt.**
   - Contemporary science writing on the biodiversity crisis
   - Accessible bridge from your current knowledge to conservation biology

### Video Resources
- [Yale Open Course: Principles of Evolution, Ecology and Behavior (EEB 122)](https://oyc.yale.edu/ecology-and-evolutionary-biology/eeb-122) — Full lecture series by Stephen Stearns
- [Crash Course: Ecology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNdTKZkV_GiIYXpV9w18s3) — Quick refresher on key concepts (12 episodes, ~10 min each)

## Bridging Exercise: Your Disciplines Meet Ecology

**Purpose**: To begin connecting your existing expertise to ecological questions.

**Exercise 0.1**: Write a 1–2 page reflection (informal) addressing:
1. What questions or problems in conservation ecology interest you most, and why?
2. How might your political science training inform conservation challenges? (Think: commons problems, institutional design, international agreements, collective action)
3. How might your data science skills be applied to ecological questions? (Think: species distribution modeling, remote sensing analysis, time series of populations)
4. What assumptions from your disciplines might not hold in ecological contexts?

**Exercise 0.2**: Read the following short paper and write a one-paragraph response:
> Ostrom, E. (2009). A general framework for analyzing sustainability of social-ecological systems. *Science*, 325(5939), 419–422. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1172133

This paper bridges political science and ecology directly. As a PSCI scholar, you likely know Ostrom's work. Consider: how does she integrate ecological variables into institutional analysis?
