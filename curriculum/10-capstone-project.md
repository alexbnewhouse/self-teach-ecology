# Module 10: Capstone Research Project

**Type**: Tier 3 capstone  
**Estimated time**: 100–180 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Modules 1–8 + 2–3 Tier 2 tracks + comprehensive exam response draft

---

## Purpose

Produce a near-publishable research artifact integrating ecology with your computational and policy strengths.

---

## Capstone Formats

1. Original empirical research
2. Systematic review or meta-analysis
3. Policy-ecology analytical report
4. Computational ecology pipeline project

---

## Ten Capstone Archetypes

1. SDM for threatened species under climate scenarios
2. Ecological network robustness under extinction cascades
3. Remote sensing assessment of restoration outcomes
4. Agent-based rewilding scenario modeling
5. Habitat connectivity analysis with circuit-theory methods
6. Camera-trap ML pipeline with occupancy inference
7. Long-term ecological time-series and regime-shift analysis
8. NLP analysis of conservation policy corpora
9. Bayesian population viability analysis
10. Social-ecological network analysis of governance and outcomes

## Milestone Sequence

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Question and Proposal

- Finalize one focused research question
- Build 20–30 paper preliminary base
- Submit 2-page proposal

## Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Methods and Design

- Expand to 50+ references where applicable
- Lock analytical plan and data strategy
- Draft methods and reproducibility plan

## Phase 3 (Weeks 9–14): Analysis

- Execute analysis with versioned code
- Generate figures/tables and uncertainty summaries
- Maintain decision log

## Phase 4 (Weeks 15–20): Write and Defend

- Produce full manuscript/report
- Self-grade with [assessments/rubrics.md](../assessments/rubrics.md)
- Optional oral defense with mentor/peer

---

## Minimum Publishable Standard

A capstone is considered complete when it includes:

1. Clear and justified research question
2. Transparent methods and data provenance
3. Reproducible analysis workflow
4. Explicit uncertainty and limitation discussion
5. Decision-relevant implications for conservation or rewilding

---

## Reproducibility Checklist

- README with abstract and workflow map
- Environment specification file
- Data source licensing and metadata
- Deterministic rerun instructions
- Figure-generation scripts
- References file and citation consistency

---

## Suggested Output Package

- Main manuscript/report (5,000–10,000 words equivalent)
- Public code repository
- Data documentation
- 1-page executive summary for non-specialist audience

---

## Post-Capstone Dissemination

- Upload preprint or working paper
- Present at relevant seminar or conference
- Write a short methods reflection for portfolio transfer
