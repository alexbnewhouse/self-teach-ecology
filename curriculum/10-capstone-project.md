# Capstone Research Project

**Estimated time**: 100–150 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Modules 1–8 + at least 2 electives  

---

## Purpose

The capstone is the culminating experience of this self-taught master's program. It is your opportunity to produce an original piece of research that integrates ecological knowledge with your strengths in political science and data science. The goal is to produce work of publishable or near-publishable quality.

## Project Types

Choose one of the following formats:

### Option A: Original Research Paper
A quantitative or mixed-methods research paper addressing a conservation ecology or rewilding question. This should follow the structure of a peer-reviewed journal article (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion).

**Target length**: 5,000–8,000 words  
**Target journals** (for calibrating quality): *Conservation Biology*, *Biological Conservation*, *Conservation Letters*, *Journal of Applied Ecology*, *Environmental Science & Policy*

### Option B: Systematic Review or Meta-Analysis
A rigorous synthesis of the literature on a defined question, following PRISMA or equivalent protocols.

**Target length**: 6,000–10,000 words  
**Guidance**: See Pullin, A.S., & Stewart, G.B. (2006). Guidelines for systematic reviews in conservation and environmental management. *Conservation Biology*, 20(6), 1647–1656.

### Option C: Policy Analysis or White Paper
A deep policy analysis of a conservation/rewilding governance question, applying political science frameworks to an ecological problem. Suitable for a policy audience.

**Target length**: 5,000–8,000 words  
**Style**: Think tank report, working paper, or policy brief

### Option D: Data Science + Ecology Project
A computational project that applies data science methods to an ecological question (e.g., species distribution modeling, remote sensing analysis, camera trap ML pipeline, network analysis of wildlife trade, NLP analysis of conservation policy documents).

**Target length**: 3,000–5,000 words + code repository + documented notebook  
**Key requirement**: The analysis must address a meaningful conservation question, not just demonstrate technical skill.

## Project Milestones

### Phase 1: Topic Selection & Literature Review (Weeks 1–4)

1. **Identify your question**: What conservation/rewilding question interests you? Where does your expertise (PSCI, DS) give you a unique angle?
2. **Conduct a preliminary literature review**: Read 20–30 relevant papers to understand the state of knowledge
3. **Write a 2-page research proposal** including:
   - Research question and its significance
   - Brief literature review
   - Proposed methods
   - Expected contribution
   - Timeline

**Deliverable**: Research proposal (2 pages)

### Phase 2: Deep Literature Review & Methods Development (Weeks 5–8)

1. **Expand your literature review** to 50–80 papers
2. **Develop your methods**: data collection plan, analytical framework, or modeling approach
3. **Write a detailed methods section** (even if you haven't collected data yet)
4. **Create an annotated bibliography** of your key sources (20–30 entries minimum)

**Deliverable**: Annotated bibliography + draft methods section

### Phase 3: Data Collection & Analysis (Weeks 9–14)

1. **Collect or compile your data**
2. **Conduct your analysis** (quantitative, qualitative, or mixed)
3. **Produce figures, tables, and visualizations**
4. **Keep a research log**: document your decisions, challenges, and pivots

**Deliverable**: Analysis notebook/code + research log

### Phase 4: Writing & Revision (Weeks 15–20)

1. **Write a complete first draft** following your chosen format
2. **Revise for clarity, argument, and evidence**
3. **Check all citations and formatting**
4. **Self-review using the rubric below**
5. **(Optional but recommended)**: Share with a colleague, mentor, or online community for feedback

**Deliverable**: Complete capstone paper

## Suggested Capstone Topics

These are examples to spark ideas. Your project should reflect your unique interests and expertise.

### Integrating PSCI + Ecology
- Governance structures and conservation outcomes: A comparative analysis of rewilding governance in Europe
- How do institutional frameworks (Ostrom's design principles) predict success/failure of community-based conservation?
- Political economy of the 30×30 target: Who wins, who loses, and what determines national implementation?
- Discourse analysis of rewilding debates: How do different actors frame "wildness"?
- Comparing conservation policy instruments: regulations vs. payments for ecosystem services vs. community governance

### Integrating Data Science + Ecology
- Species distribution modeling for rewilding candidate species under climate change
- Machine learning for automated monitoring of rewilding outcomes using satellite or camera trap data
- Network analysis of wildlife trade or conservation policy networks
- Time series analysis of population recovery after reintroduction
- NLP analysis of conservation policy documents or public discourse about rewilding
- Spatial optimization of corridor design for a rewilding landscape

### Integrating All Three (PSCI + DS + Ecology)
- Geospatial analysis of the gap between protected area targets (30×30) and current coverage, combined with governance quality indicators
- Modeling the political feasibility of rewilding in different governance contexts
- Quantitative analysis of how governance variables predict conservation outcomes across countries
- Using satellite data and institutional analysis to evaluate "paper parks"

## Research Ethics

Even as a self-directed learner, maintain ethical research standards:
- Properly cite all sources
- Use data in accordance with their licenses
- Be transparent about methods and limitations
- If your project involves human subjects (interviews, surveys), consider IRB principles even if not formally required
- Acknowledge biases and positionality

## Evaluation Rubric

Use this rubric for self-assessment. If possible, also have a colleague or mentor evaluate your work.

| Criterion | Developing (1) | Proficient (2) | Advanced (3) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Research question** | Vague or overly broad | Clear, specific, and relevant | Well-motivated, novel, addresses a gap |
| **Literature review** | Incomplete or superficial | Comprehensive, well-organized | Critically synthesized, identifies gaps |
| **Methods** | Inappropriate or poorly described | Appropriate and clearly described | Rigorous, well-justified, reproducible |
| **Analysis/Results** | Incomplete or incorrect | Competent and clear | Sophisticated, thorough, well-visualized |
| **Discussion** | Descriptive, no interpretation | Interprets results in context | Synthesizes across fields, identifies implications |
| **Writing quality** | Unclear, poorly organized | Clear, well-structured | Publication-quality prose |
| **Interdisciplinary integration** | Single-discipline approach | Draws on 2+ fields | Genuinely integrates ecology, PSCI, and/or DS |
| **Originality** | Replicates existing work | Adds incremental value | Makes a novel contribution |

**Target**: Score 2+ on all criteria, with 3 on at least 2–3 criteria.

## After the Capstone

Congratulations — you've completed the equivalent of a master's program in conservation ecology and rewilding. Consider:

1. **Publish your capstone** — in a peer-reviewed journal, as a preprint, or as a blog post
2. **Present your work** — at a conference (ESA, ICCB, SCB) or a seminar
3. **Continue learning** — this curriculum has given you foundations; the field is vast and evolving
4. **Apply your knowledge** — in your PSCI research, in policy work, in advocacy, or in interdisciplinary collaboration
5. **Contribute back** — improve this curriculum for future learners
