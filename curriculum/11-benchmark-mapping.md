# Module 11: Benchmark Mapping to Leading Ecology Master's Programs

**Estimated time**: 6–10 hours  
**Type**: Audit and synthesis module  
**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Modules 0–10

---

## Purpose

This module documents how the curriculum aligns with master's-level expectations from:

- UC Davis Graduate Group in Ecology
- Yale School of the Environment (MEM/MESc)
- Duke Nicholas School (MEM)
- ETH Zurich (Environmental Sciences, Ecology & Evolution major)
- Imperial College (Conservation Science / Living Planet)

## Universal Pillars Coverage Check

| Pillar | Benchmark Expectation | Curriculum Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Core ecology theory | 1–2 graduate ecology cores | Modules 1, 2, 4, 7 |
| Quantitative methods | At least one graduate methods sequence | Modules 4, 5, 6 + Computational Track |
| Research methods/design | Formal methods training and seminar practice | Module 0 research prep, Module 10 methods phases, assessments blueprint |
| Thesis/capstone | Independent project with substantial written output | Module 10 capstone + assessment rubrics |

## Program-by-Program Mapping

## UC Davis (ECL 200A/200B + emphasis)

- **Core ecology series equivalent**: Module 1 (foundations) + Module 4 (landscape) + Module 7 (climate ecology)
- **Conservation emphasis equivalent**: Module 2 + Module 3 + elective tracks
- **Methods readiness**: Module 5 quantitative ecology, Module 6 genetics, capstone methods section

## Yale MEM/MESc (foundations + methods + specialization + thesis)

- **Foundations and perspectives**: Modules 1, 2, 8
- **Methods requirement equivalent**: Module 5 + Assessments comprehensive blueprint
- **Specialization credits equivalent**: Tier 2 tracks (choose 2–3)
- **Thesis credits equivalent**: Module 10 4-phase capstone workflow

## Duke MEM (environment + analytics)

- **Environment concentration equivalent**: Modules 1, 2, 4, 7
- **Analytics/modeling concentration equivalent**: Module 5 + Computational Ecology Track
- **Dual-concentration integration**: Module 8 governance + data-intensive capstone options

## ETH Zurich Ecology & Evolution major

- **Foundation block**: Modules 1, 6, 7
- **Advanced concepts**: Modules 3, 4, 5 + Systems Ecology and Restoration tracks
- **Technical competencies**: GIS/remote sensing, Bayesian modeling, SDM, ABM, network analysis
- **Seminar/term paper equivalent**: module syntheses + comprehensive exam essays
- **Thesis equivalent**: Module 10 capstone deliverable

## Imperial Conservation Science / Living Planet

- **Bridge for non-biologists**: Module 0 prerequisite pathway
- **Systems thinking and decision focus**: Module 8 + Systems Ecology Track
- **Applied methods and practical work**: Landscape, quantitative, restoration practicum, field checklists
- **Independent project**: Module 10 capstone with reproducibility and quality checks

## Competency Equivalence Matrix

| Competency Domain | Required Evidence | Evidence Source in Curriculum |
|---|---|---|
| Ecological theory integration | Cross-scale written synthesis | Module syntheses + comprehensive exam |
| Quantitative ecological methods | Reproducible notebooks and model diagnostics | Module 4/5 exercises + Computational Track |
| Conservation decision analysis | Policy/governance analysis with ecological grounding | Module 8 exercises + capstone options |
| Applied restoration/rewilding reasoning | Case-based design and monitoring plan | Module 3 + Restoration Track practicum |
| Independent research quality | Near-publishable capstone artifact | Module 10 + rubrics |

---

## Gaps and Ongoing Improvements

1. Add more explicit organismal and field-methods prerequisites in Module 0.
2. Keep annual updates for methods software stacks and package recommendations.
3. Add optional mentor-reviewed oral defense protocol for capstone completion.
