# Module 8: Conservation Policy & Governance

**Estimated time**: 60–80 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Modules 2–3 + Political Science background  
**Parallelizable with**: Modules 4–7

---

## Preamble: Leveraging Your Political Science Background

As a PSCI PhD, you bring substantial expertise in governance, institutions, collective action, policy analysis, and international relations. This module builds on that foundation, focusing on the **specific policy and governance landscape of conservation and rewilding**. Where a typical ecology graduate student might encounter policy as a new and unfamiliar field, you can engage with these topics at a more advanced level — critically evaluating institutional design, analyzing power dynamics, and applying theoretical frameworks from political science to conservation problems.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Map the global and national institutional architecture of biodiversity conservation
2. Analyze conservation governance using political science frameworks (collective action, institutional analysis, policy process)
3. Evaluate major international environmental agreements (CBD, CITES, Ramsar, CMS, Paris Agreement)
4. Critically assess the governance dimensions of rewilding projects
5. Understand the political economy of conservation and land use
6. Engage with environmental justice and Indigenous rights in conservation
7. Apply policy analysis tools to conservation challenges

## Synthesis Prompt

**Write a 3,000-word policy paper** addressing:

> *"Design a governance framework for a large-scale rewilding initiative in a region of your choice. Your framework should address: institutional design, stakeholder engagement, financing mechanisms, monitoring and accountability, conflict resolution, and environmental justice. Ground your analysis in both ecological evidence (from earlier modules) and political science theory. This paper should be written in the style of a policy brief or working paper suitable for an interdisciplinary audience."*

This exercise directly integrates your PSCI expertise with your ecological knowledge from the curriculum.
