# Specialization Track: Systems Ecology and Complexity

**Type**: Tier 2 specialization track  
**Estimated time**: 45–70 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Modules 1, 4, 5

## Learning Outcomes

1. Explain feedbacks, leverage points, and adaptive cycles in ecological systems.
2. Analyze resilience and regime-shift dynamics with empirical indicators.
3. Build and interpret ecological network models.
4. Design and document agent-based models using ODD protocol standards.
