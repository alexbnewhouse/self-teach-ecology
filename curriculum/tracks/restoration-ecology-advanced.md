# Specialization Track: Restoration Ecology (Advanced)

**Type**: Tier 2 specialization track  
**Estimated time**: 45–70 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Modules 1, 2, 4

---

## Learning Outcomes

1. Apply SER standards to restoration design and evaluation.
2. Distinguish restoration, rehabilitation, and rewilding interventions.
3. Use succession, soil ecology, and community assembly theory in practice.
4. Build adaptive monitoring frameworks with clear recovery metrics.
