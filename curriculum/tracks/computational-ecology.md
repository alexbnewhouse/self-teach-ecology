# Specialization Track: Computational Ecology

**Type**: Tier 2 specialization track  
**Estimated time**: 50–80 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Modules 4, 5 (recommended: Module 7)

---

## Learning Outcomes

1. Build end-to-end computational workflows from ecological question to decision-relevant output.
2. Select among SDM, Bayesian, remote sensing, and network approaches based on inference goals.
3. Document reproducibility with data provenance and environment management.
4. Communicate uncertainty in conservation-relevant terms.

## Method Pathways

## Pathway A: Species Distribution Modeling

- Tools: MaxEnt or maxnet, biomod2, ENMeval
- Output: baseline and climate-scenario habitat suitability maps

## Pathway B: Bayesian Ecology

- Tools: brms, Stan, PyMC
- Output: hierarchical ecological model with posterior predictive checks

## Pathway C: Remote Sensing for Biodiversity and Restoration

- Tools: Google Earth Engine, geemap, terra/sf
- Output: change-detection workflow with ecological interpretation

## Pathway D: Ecological Network Analysis

- Tools: bipartite, igraph, NetworkX
- Output: network robustness and interaction-structure analysis

---

## Reproducibility Standard

Each project must include:

- README with question, data sources, and workflow
- Environment file and package versions
- Data provenance and licensing notes
- Scripted rerun instructions

---

## Deliverables

- At least one completed pathway project notebook
- One comparative methods memo (1,500 words)
- One capstone-ready project proposal using computational methods
