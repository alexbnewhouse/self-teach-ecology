## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Explain the ecological consequences of anthropogenic climate change across multiple levels of biological organization
2. Analyze evidence for climate-driven changes in species distributions, phenology, and community composition
3. Evaluate conservation strategies for a changing climate (assisted migration, climate corridors, climate-adaptive management)

- Tracking climate vs. evolutionary adaptation
- Generalists vs. specialists under climate change
- Mountain-top extinctions and elevational range squeezing
- Coral bleaching and marine range shifts
- Phenotypic plasticity vs. genetic adaptation
- Evolutionary rescue

### Exercise 7.1: Climate-Driven Range Shift Analysis
Using species occurrence data and climate data:
1. Select a species with documented range shifts (e.g., Edith's checkerspot butterfly, great tit, pika)
2. Obtain historical and recent occurrence records from GBIF
3. Overlay with climate data (temperature, precipitation) from WorldClim or CRU
4. Analyze evidence for range shift (latitudinal or elevational)
5. Project future suitable habitat under RCP/SSP climate scenarios
6. Connect to species distribution modeling skills from Module 4

**Deliverable**: Analysis notebook with maps and 1,000-word discussion.

2. Identify species or ecosystems most at risk
3. Evaluate whether current management strategies account for climate change
4. Propose climate-adaptive modifications to the conservation plan
5. Address the assisted migration question: should climate-threatened species be moved?

## Synthesis Prompt

**Write a 2,000-word essay** addressing:

> *"How should rewilding strategies be adjusted for a world undergoing rapid climate change? Consider: shifting baselines, the relevance of historical reference conditions, climate corridors, and the potential for rewilding to contribute to climate mitigation. Are we rewilding toward a past that no longer exists, or toward a future we cannot predict?"*
