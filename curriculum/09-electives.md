## How to Choose Electives

Consider:
1. **What topics excite you most?** Choose at least one elective based on genuine curiosity.
2. **Career relevance**: If you want to publish at the intersection of PSCI and ecology, Elective C (Political Ecology) is especially relevant. If you want practical DS applications, choose Elective F.
3. **Capstone synergy**: Choose electives that complement your planned capstone project.
4. **Balance**: Try to include both a "science-deep" elective (A, B, D, or E) and a "governance/methods" elective (C or F).
