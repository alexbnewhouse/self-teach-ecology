# Electives and Specializations (Tier 2)

**Estimated time**: 90–180 hours total  
**Required choice**: Complete 2–3 tracks before capstone

---

## How Tier 2 Works

Tier 2 deepens your expertise through focused tracks. Choose combinations that support your capstone direction.

- At least one ecology-deep track
- At least one methods or governance-oriented track

---

## Priority Tracks (New)

1. [Systems Ecology and Complexity](tracks/systems-ecology-complexity.md)
2. [Restoration Ecology (Advanced)](tracks/restoration-ecology-advanced.md)
3. [Computational Ecology](tracks/computational-ecology.md)

---

## Existing Elective Domains (From v1.0)

Use these as additional or substitute tracks if they better fit your interests:

- Marine Conservation and Rewilding
- Political Ecology and Environmental Anthropology
- Wildlife Ecology and Management
- Freshwater and Wetland Ecology
- Conservation Technology and Data Science

If you pursue one of these domains, document:

1. Core readings selected
2. One major applied deliverable
3. How the domain connects to your capstone

## Recommended Track Bundles

## Bundle A: Systems and Forecasting

- Systems Ecology and Complexity
- Computational Ecology

Best for regime shifts, forecasting, and network-driven capstones.

## Bundle B: Policy-Relevant Restoration

- Restoration Ecology (Advanced)
- Political ecology domain

Best for governance and implementation research.

## Bundle C: Applied Rewilding Analytics

- Computational Ecology
- Wildlife or marine domain

Best for data-heavy rewilding evaluations.

---

## Tier 2 Completion Criteria

- Minimum two completed track deliverables
- At least one reproducible computational project
- At least one long-form written synthesis
- Updated portfolio entries in [PROGRESS.md](../PROGRESS.md)
