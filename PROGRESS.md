## Reflections

Use this space for periodic reflections on your learning journey.

### After Module 2 (midpoint check-in):
_How is the curriculum working for you? What adjustments do you need?_



### After Module 5 (skills check-in):
_Which quantitative methods feel most natural? Where do you need more practice?_



### After Module 8 (pre-capstone):
_What has surprised you? What connections between ecology and your other fields have emerged?_



### After Capstone (final reflection):
_What do you know now that you didn't before? How has this changed your research?_
