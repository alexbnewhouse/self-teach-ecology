# Comprehensive Exam Blueprint

**Estimated time**: 10–16 hours  
**Format**: Written synthesis exam + optional oral defense

---

## Purpose

This blueprint verifies master's-level synthesis after completion of core modules and before capstone completion.

## Exam Structure

- Section A: Ecological theory integration (2 prompts, answer 1)
- Section B: Conservation and governance (2 prompts, answer 1)
- Section C: Quantitative methods and inference (2 prompts, answer 1)
- Section D: Integrative applied scenario (1 required prompt)

Target: 4 total essays, 1,000–1,500 words each.

---

## Section A Prompts (choose 1)

1. Compare resilience, stability, and regime shifts across at least two ecosystems. Include theoretical mechanisms and management implications.
2. Explain how scale and pattern interact in ecology, and how this affects biodiversity monitoring and conservation interventions.

## Section B Prompts (choose 1)

1. Evaluate the 30x30 target through ecological effectiveness, governance feasibility, and equity implications.
2. Compare two rewilding governance models and assess trade-offs among ecological outcomes, legitimacy, and social acceptance.

## Section C Prompts (choose 1)

1. Design a defensible analytical strategy for imperfect-detection biodiversity data. Justify model class and uncertainty communication.
2. Compare Bayesian and frequentist approaches for a conservation forecasting problem and justify which you would deploy.

## Section D Required Prompt

A landscape is experiencing biodiversity decline, fragmented governance, and rapid climate pressure. Propose a 5-year intervention portfolio that integrates ecological theory, quantitative monitoring, and institutional design. Include indicators, decision thresholds, and adaptive feedback loops.
