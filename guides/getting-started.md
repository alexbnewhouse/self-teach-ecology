# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the Self-Taught Conservation Ecology curriculum! This guide will help you take your first steps on your learning journey.

## 🎯 Before You Begin

### 1. Assess Your Starting Point

**Take 15 minutes to reflect:**

✅ Why do you want to learn conservation ecology?
- Career change?
- Complement existing work?
- Personal passion?
- Preparation for graduate school?

✅ What's your current background?

Example note structure:
```markdown
# [Topic Name]

## Key Concepts
- 
- 

## Questions
- 
- 

## Connections
How does this relate to:
- 
- 

## To Explore Further
- 
```

**Create Your First Concept Note:**

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Learning Strategies

**Active Learning:**
- Don't just read - take notes, ask questions, teach concepts to others
- Work through examples yourself before looking at solutions
- Create concept maps connecting ideas
- Explain concepts out loud (rubber duck method)

**Spaced Repetition:**
- Review material multiple times over weeks
- Use flashcards for key terms and concepts
- Revisit earlier modules as you progress

**Deep Work:**
- Eliminate distractions during study time
- Use Pomodoro technique (25 min focus, 5 min break)
- Have specific goals for each session
- No multitasking

### Staying Motivated

**Short-term:**
- Set daily/weekly goals
- Track completion (checkboxes are satisfying!)
- Reward yourself for milestones
- Study with others when possible

**Long-term:**
- Remember your "why"
- Apply learning immediately (volunteer, projects)
- Celebrate module completions
- Visualize your end goal

### When You Struggle

**It's normal to:**
- Find some topics difficult
- Need to re-read material
- Take longer than expected
- Feel overwhelmed sometimes
- Question if you can do this

**When you're stuck:**
1. Review prerequisites - do you have the foundation?
2. Seek different explanations (videos, other textbooks, online courses)
3. Ask for help in communities
4. Take a break and return with fresh perspective
5. Adjust your pace - there's no shame in going slower

**When to adjust:**
- Consistently falling behind schedule → reduce pace
- Finding material too easy → speed up or add challenge
- Losing motivation → reconnect with purpose, find accountability
