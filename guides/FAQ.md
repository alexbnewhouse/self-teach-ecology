# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### Is this curriculum really equivalent to a master's degree?

This curriculum covers the knowledge and skills typically taught in conservation ecology master's programs. However:
- ✅ You'll gain master's-level knowledge and practical skills
- ✅ You'll build a portfolio demonstrating your abilities
- ❌ You won't receive an accredited degree or transcript
- ❌ You won't have formal supervision or institutional support

The curriculum is designed to prepare you for conservation work or further graduate study, but it doesn't replace an actual degree for positions requiring formal credentials.

### How long does it take to complete?

**Core curriculum:** 18-24 months at 15-20 hours/week  
**With specializations:** 24-36 months total

Your pace may vary based on:
- Your background (prior knowledge speeds things up)
- Time available (more hours/week = faster completion)
- Depth of engagement (rushing vs. thorough learning)

### Do I need prior education in biology or ecology?

**Required:** Basic scientific literacy, ability to read research papers  
**Helpful but not required:** Biology, environmental science, statistics

The curriculum is designed to be accessible to those with non-science backgrounds, especially in social sciences and data science. Module 1 starts with fundamentals.

### What if I have a different background than political science/data science?

The curriculum is adaptable! The core modules work for anyone. Choose specializations matching your interests and background:
- **Engineering/CS background:** Conservation Data Science, Quantitative Ecology
- **Social science background:** Conservation Policy & Governance
- **Biology background:** Wildlife Conservation, Marine Conservation
- **Geography/GIS background:** Landscape Ecology emphasis

### Can I work full-time while doing this?

Yes! Many learners balance this curriculum with full-time work. Tips:
- Dedicate consistent study times (early morning, evenings, weekends)
- Expect 2-3 years to complete at 10-15 hours/week
- Use vacation time for intensive modules or field work
- Be realistic about your capacity

### Is this curriculum free?

The curriculum itself is free (CC BY-SA license). However, you may have costs for:
- **Textbooks:** $200-500 (many are available from libraries or as cheaper used copies)
- **Software:** Most recommended tools are free/open-source
- **Professional society memberships:** ~$40-100/year (optional but valuable)
- **Field work:** Variable costs if you do field-based projects

Estimated total cost: $300-800, far less than tuition for a master's degree.

## Technical Questions

### Do I need to know how to code?

**For core modules:** Basic programming helpful but not required initially  
**For specializations:** Yes, particularly Conservation Data Science and Quantitative Ecology

You'll learn R or Python as you progress through Module 3 (Ecological Methods). If you have no programming experience, start with free tutorials before or during Module 1.

### R or Python?

**R is standard in ecology** - most ecologists use R for data analysis, and more ecology-specific packages exist.

**Python is fine too**, especially if you already know it or plan to focus on Conservation Data Science (machine learning, deep learning).

**Our recommendation:** Learn R first, add Python later if needed for specific applications.

### What computer do I need?

Most work can be done on any modern computer:
- **OS:** Windows, Mac, or Linux all work
- **RAM:** 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended for GIS/remote sensing work
- **Storage:** 50-100GB free space for software, data, and projects
- **Internet:** Required for accessing papers, online courses, and data

### Do I need access to academic journals?

Many papers are open access, but you'll encounter some paywalls. Options:
- Local library access (many have digital subscriptions)
- **Unpaywall browser extension** (finds legal free versions)
- **Google Scholar** (often links to free PDFs)
- Email authors directly (usually happy to share)
- **ResearchGate** (request papers from authors)

## Learning Questions

### How do I stay motivated over 2+ years?

Strategies that help:
- **Find a study partner** - accountability and support
- **Set milestones** - celebrate completing modules
- **Join communities** - engagement keeps you connected
- **Apply immediately** - volunteer with local conservation groups
- **Track progress** - maintain a learning journal
- **Remember your why** - revisit your goals regularly

### What if I get stuck on a concept or exercise?

Resources for help:
1. Online communities (Reddit r/ecology, Stack Exchange)
2. Study partners or study groups
3. Office hours from online courses covering similar material
4. Textbook authors (some respond to emails)
5. Local university professors (may allow you to audit office hours)
6. YouTube tutorials and explanations

### Should I follow the curriculum order exactly?

**Core modules:** Yes, follow the order - they build on each other  
**Specializations:** Start after completing core modules; order within specializations is flexible

You can adjust pacing within modules based on your background. If you're already strong in a topic, you can move faster.

### How do I know if I'm learning effectively?

Self-assessment indicators:
- Can you explain concepts to others?
- Can you complete exercises without extensive help?
- Can you apply concepts to new situations?
- Can you critique papers and identify flaws?
- Are you contributing to online discussions?
- Could you teach this material?

## Career Questions

### Will this help me get a conservation job?

This curriculum builds valuable knowledge and skills. To maximize career benefits:
- **Build a portfolio** - showcase your projects publicly
- **Gain practical experience** - volunteer or intern
- **Network** - engage with professionals and communities
- **Develop niche expertise** - specialize in high-demand areas
- **Demonstrate impact** - contribute to real conservation projects

Many conservation employers value demonstrated skills and passion over formal degrees, especially for some roles.

### What jobs can I get with this curriculum?

Potential roles (depending on specialization and experience):
- **Entry-level:** Conservation technician, field technician, GIS analyst, data analyst
- **Mid-level:** Project coordinator, conservation scientist, wildlife biologist
- **Specialized:** Data scientist, remote sensing analyst, policy analyst

**Note:** Some positions legally require specific degrees (e.g., government wildlife biologist positions). This curriculum prepares you for knowledge-based roles but may not meet credential requirements.

### Should I do this instead of a master's degree?

Consider a formal master's if you:
- Need credentials for specific career paths
- Want structured mentorship and networking
- Can afford it without excessive debt
- Want to do research requiring institutional resources
- Need visa sponsorship (many countries require formal enrollment)

Consider self-teaching if you:
- Already have a graduate degree in another field
- Cannot afford or access traditional programs
- Need flexible, self-paced learning
- Want to transition careers without returning to school full-time
- Can gain experience through work/volunteering alongside learning

**Best of both worlds:** Some people complete this curriculum, build a portfolio, then apply to master's or PhD programs from a stronger position.

### Can this help me get into a PhD program?

Yes, if you:
- Complete the curriculum thoroughly
- Conduct substantial research projects
- Publish or present work publicly
- Build relationships with researchers
- Demonstrate independent research ability
- Have strong letters of recommendation (from work, volunteering, or collaborations)

Many PhD programs care more about research potential than specific degree titles. A strong portfolio and demonstrated skills can compensate for non-traditional backgrounds.
