# Restoration Practicum

**Estimated time**: 12–20 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Module 2, Module 4, Restoration Track (recommended)

---

## Objective

Design a practical restoration plan for a local degraded site (or a clearly defined simulated site if field access is limited) using SER-aligned standards.

## Step 1: Site Diagnostic

- Define site boundaries and context
- Document current conditions with maps and photos
- Identify principal degradation drivers

## Step 2: Reference and Targets

- Propose reference ecosystem conditions
- Define 5–8 measurable recovery indicators
- Set 1-year and 3-year target thresholds

## Step 3: Intervention Design

- Select intervention actions (planting, invasive control, hydrology, access management)
- Provide ecological rationale for each action
- Note dependencies, risks, and assumptions

## Step 4: Monitoring Design

- Specify sampling design and frequency
- Define methods for vegetation, soil, and disturbance indicators
- Add adaptive triggers and response rules

## Deliverables

1. Restoration plan (2,500–4,000 words)
2. Monitoring table with indicators and thresholds
3. One map (QGIS or equivalent)
4. Photo-point protocol

## Evaluation Criteria

- Ecological validity
- Alignment with SER standards
- Monitoring feasibility
- Clarity of adaptive management logic
