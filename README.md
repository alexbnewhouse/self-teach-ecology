## About This Curriculum

This is a free, open-source, self-paced curriculum designed to provide the equivalent of a Master of Science in Conservation Ecology with a specialization in Rewilding. It is modeled after open-source self-taught degree programs like [OSSU Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), but adapted for an interdisciplinary ecological science context.

**This curriculum is specifically tailored** for a learner with:
- A **PhD background in Political Science** (bringing expertise in governance, institutions, policy analysis, and research methodology)
- An **MS in Data Science** (bringing expertise in statistics, machine learning, programming, and quantitative analysis)

These backgrounds are treated as assets, not gaps. The curriculum leverages your quantitative and governance expertise throughout, while building deep ecological knowledge from the ground up.

### Design Principles

1. **Academic rigor**: Every module is built on peer-reviewed literature, canonical textbooks, and university-level coursework
2. **Flexibility**: Choose electives and a capstone that match your specific interests
3. **Applied learning**: Each module includes hands-on exercises, not just reading
4. **Interdisciplinary integration**: Your PSCI and data science skills are woven in as strengths
5. **Open access priority**: Free or openly available resources are preferred; paywalled materials note alternatives

### Time Commitment

| Pace | Weekly Hours | Est. Duration |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Full-time | 30–40 hrs | 12–18 months |
| Half-time | 15–20 hrs | 24–30 months |
| Casual | 8–10 hrs | 36+ months |

## How to Use This Curriculum

1. **Start with Module 0** to assess your background and fill any gaps
2. **Work through Modules 1–8** roughly in order (see prerequisite notes for parallelization options)
3. **Select 2–3 electives** that align with your interests
4. **Complete the capstone project** — an original piece of research or a systematic review
5. **Track your progress** using [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md)

### Assessment Philosophy

There are no grades here. Instead, each module provides:
- **Comprehension checks**: Key questions you should be able to answer
- **Applied exercises**: Practical work (data analysis, policy briefs, literature reviews)
- **Synthesis prompts**: Essay-style questions that integrate across modules
- **Self-evaluation rubrics**: Criteria for assessing your own understanding

### Building Your Portfolio

As you work through the curriculum, you will build a portfolio of:
- Annotated bibliographies
- Data analysis notebooks (Jupyter/R Markdown)
- Policy briefs and literature reviews
- A capstone research paper or project
- (Optional) Blog posts or public writing
