![License: CC BY-SA 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--SA%204.0-lightgrey.svg)

A comprehensive, self-paced curriculum for achieving master's degree-level expertise in conservation ecology and rewilding. This curriculum is designed for self-directed learners, particularly those with backgrounds in social sciences and data science.

## 🎯 About This Program

This curriculum is modeled after successful open-source educational initiatives like [OSSU Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). It provides a structured path through conservation ecology, rewilding, and ecological restoration, with emphasis on:

- **Evidence-based learning**: Peer-reviewed literature and scientific texts
- **Practical application**: Field exercises, data analysis projects, and case studies
- **Flexibility**: Choose specializations aligned with your interests
- **Interdisciplinary approach**: Bridging ecology with social science, policy, and data science

### Who This Is For

This curriculum is particularly suited for:
- Self-directed learners seeking master's level knowledge in conservation ecology
- Those with backgrounds in social sciences (e.g., political science) transitioning to ecology
- Data scientists interested in ecological applications
- Conservation practitioners seeking systematic theoretical foundation
- Anyone passionate about biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Basic understanding of scientific method
- Ability to read scientific literature
- Commitment to self-directed learning (15-20 hours/week for 18-24 months)

**Helpful but not required:**
- Background in statistics/data analysis
- Basic biology or environmental science
- Experience with R or Python

## 📚 Curriculum Structure

The curriculum is organized into **core modules** (required) and **specialization tracks** (choose based on interests). Each module includes:
- 📖 Reading lists (textbooks, papers, and online resources)
- 🎯 Learning objectives
- 💻 Exercises and projects
- ✅ Self-assessment checkpoints
