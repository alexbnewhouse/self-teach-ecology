# Open-Source Self-Taught Master's in Conservation Ecology and Rewilding

An open, rigorous, self-directed curriculum designed for learners building master's-level expertise in conservation ecology and rewilding.

This curriculum is tailored for a learner with:

- PhD-in-progress in Political Science
- MS in Data Science and Analytics
- Strong Python, R, ML, and network analysis skills
- Limited formal ecology training

---

## Benchmark Alignment

Curriculum design is mapped to expectations from UC Davis, Yale, Duke, ETH Zurich, and Imperial.
